1) When adding a new product - current logged in user should be automatically added as a vendor
2) Error encountered when you logout after JWT expires - need to resolve this....
3) Need to implement protect, that is similar to isLoggedIn but gives out specific errors...
4) Make VendorName unique in USER Model
5) MySettings page craps out if user has no products - CHECK
6) clicking on BID craps out if user not logged in.. FInal error coming from getProduct
